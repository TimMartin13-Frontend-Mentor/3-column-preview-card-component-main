## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about nesting tags in SCSS, and using the same classes for each section so that I can style them all at the same time.

```css
&:hover {
  background-color: transparent;
  color: $trans-white;
}
```


### Continued development

I want to continue working on SCSS functionality and start moving my projects into my React library.


### Useful resources

- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - The best Flexbox cheatsheet I have found.
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax) - Sass documentation really helps.
